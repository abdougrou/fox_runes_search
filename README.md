## Languages :
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* Javascript

## Why I made this :
Every time I play a League Of Legends game I search for champion guide on internet to pick his approrpriate runes page.
And this part took me time and I have only 25 secondes to do that. That's why I thought about making this extension to optimize this process.

## What I learned for this experience:
* Since it's the first time I am using Javascript, I learned a lot about Javascript syntax and how it works in general.
* Calling functions in Javascript
* Add event listeners
* Match function to HTML elements
* Use Bootstrap library
